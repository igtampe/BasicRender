## BasicGraphics
BasicGraphics includes tools for drawing DrawFile (DF) and Hi-Color DrawFiles (HC) files (Both from disk, as a resource, or as its own type of internal class). These can support 16 Colors and a litle over 256 Colors (around 370 though supporting 768 different combinations) respectively.

|True Color|HiColor|DrawFile|
|-|-|-|

These files can be edited by the [Henja3 Editor](https://github.com/igtampe/Henja3), or generated by [ImageToBasicGraphic](https://github.com/igtampe/ImageToBasicGraphic). The following is an example of these two formats being taken to their limits by ITBG, with a console font of Lucida Console at 5pt. 

|Example 1|Example 2|

*In order for the combined image to line up, we lightly squooshed the images, since console characters are not square. Lucida Console 5pt has characters that are 3x5. ITBG doubles horizontal characters to try to combat this, resulting in pixels being 6x5 (which is closer). To combine the images, we shrunk it horizontally to 5/6 size.*

BasicGraphics depends on BasicRender. It has several classes, mentioned below.

### Graphic
Abstract class that basically everything inherits either directly or indirectly.
|Property|Description|
|-|-|
|Contents|Data used to draw this graphic|
|Name|Name of this graphic|
|Width|Width of this graphic accessed via GetWidth()|
|Height|Height of this graphic accessed via GetHeight()|

|Method|Result|
|-|-|
|Draw()|Draws the graphic.<br><br><b>Take note!</b><br> the parameters LeftPos and TopPos refer to the leftmost, and topmost coordinate of the graphic!|

### GraphicUtils
A Static class that holds some utilities that are used by the graphic drawers, but that could also be useful for other reasons.
|Method|Result|
|-|-|
|ResourceToStringarray()|Gets a resource as an array of bytes, and turns it into an array of strings, where each index is a line of the resource's text. <br> Essentially, it's like File.ReadAllLines(), but for resources instead of files.|
|ColorCharToConsoleColor()| Converts a ColorChar (a hexadecimal number) to a ConsoleColor. </br></br> ColorChars are based on the way the windows command line asks for colors. Below this is a table of ColorChars|

|Number|Color|
|-|-|
|0|Black|
|1|Blue|
|2|Green|
|3|Aqua|
|4|Red|
|5|Purple|
|6|Yellow|
|7|White|
|8|Gray|
|9|Light Blue|
|A|Light Green|
|B|Light Aqua|
|C|Light Red|
|D|Light Purple|
|E|Light Yellow|
|F|Bright White|


### BasicGraphic
Class that holds the way to process DF file data. It is **no longer extended** by BasicGraphicFromFile and BasicGraphicFromResource. Instead, use LoadFromFile() and LoadFromResource() in BasicGraphic

|Method|Result|
|-|-|
|DrawColorString()|This method is publicly accessible in case a user wants to access it directly to draw a single line of DF data.<br><br> A ColorString is a string made up of ColorChars. Take a look at GraphicUtils's ColorCharToConsoleColor() method for a more in depth explination.|
|LoadFromFile()|Loads DF Data from a file and returns a BasicGraphic|
|LoadFromResource()|Loads DF Data from a resource, and returns a BascGraphic|

### HiColorGraphic
Abstract class that holds the way to process HC file data. It is **no longer extended** by HiColorGraphicFromFile and HiColorGraphicFromResource. Instead use LoadFromFile() and LoadFromResource() in HiColorGraphic.

|Method|Result|
|-|-|
|HiColorDraw()|This method is also publicly accessible in case a user wants to access it directly to draw a single line of HC data. <br><br>A string of HiColor Data is comprised of multiple 3 character long strings, linked with hyphens. The first two characters are ColorChars (one for background and one for foreground), and the 3rd is a digit from 0 to 2, which indicates the gradient between the colorchars, with ░ as 0, ▒ as 1, ▓ as 2. <br><br> The following string holds a HiColor Rainbow `441-460-461-C61-CE0-CE1-CE2-EE2-E10-EA1-AE2-AE1-AA2-AB1-AB2-BB2-3B2-B31-3B2-3B1-3B0-331-932-392-992-192-912-190-110-512-152-551-D52-D51-D50-DD0-4D2-4D1-4D0-440`.|
|LoadFromFile()|Loads HC Data from a file and returns a HiColorGraphic
|LoadFromResource()|Loads HC Data from a resource, and returns a HiColorGraphic

### Cloud
Cloud is a DF graphic class which holds its own data. Its contents are the cloud graphic from AirportBoard's weather information.<br>
Use it to draw a cute little cloud, and nothing else.
